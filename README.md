### Docker Base Images for the armhf Platform

As Docker doesn't officially support armhf, there are little armhf base images to be found.
These are the sources for the automated build process of armhf base images. The results can be found here: https://hub.docker.com/r/container4armhf/
To provide a environment as trustless and open as possible, images are not directly pushed to docker, but are built via Dockerfile from scratch and an added rootfs.

I'll add more description, more images and different branches lateron.
